# DAA-lab
## This repo contains assignments and programs for Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab
#### * week-1 : searching algorithms 
[1. linear search - O(n)](week-1/linear_search.cpp) 
[2. binary search - O(log n)]  
3. jump search - O(sqrt(n))  
4. exponential search - O(log n)

#### * week-2 :
1. duplicates - to find no. of occurences of a given element in array - O(log n)
2. indices_sum - to find three indices i, j, k such that arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k] - O(n^3)
3. difference - to count the number of pairs of integers such that their difference is equal to a given key - O(n^2)

#### * week-3 : sorting algorithms 
1. insertion sort - O(n^2)
2. selection sort - O(n^2)
3. merge sort - O(n*log n)

#### * week-4 : sorting algorithms 
1. merge sort - O(n*log n)
2. randomised quick sort - O(n*log n)
3. partial quick sort - O(n)

#### * week-5 :
1. count character with max. occurence in an array - O(n)
2. pair_sum - to find whether two elements exist such that their sum is equal to the given key element- O(n*log n)
3. common_element - to find list of elements which are common to two sorted integer arrays of size m and n - O(m+n)
