# DAA-lab
## This repo contains assignments and programs for Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab
#### * week-1 : searching algorithms 
1. linear search - O(n) 
2. binary search - O(log n)  
3. jump search - O(sqrt(n))  
4. exponential search - O(log n)

#### * week-2 :
1. duplicates - to find no. of occurences of a given element in array - O(log n)
2. indices_sum - to find three indices i, j, k such that arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k] - O(n^3)
3. difference - to count the number of pairs of integers such that their difference is equal to a given key - O(n^2)
